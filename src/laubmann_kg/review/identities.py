"""Reviewed identities of name forms (validation UI export ``review/identities.csv``).

The review unit is the NAME FORM: a taxon, person, place or habitat name as it
is written in the diary. A reviewer decides which entity the form denotes; the
linking and resolution stages then follow that decision instead of their
rules, so a merge is a consequence of two forms denoting the same entity
(same GBIF taxon, same person, same place). Decisions keyed by the written
form survive re-extraction, because the forms come from the text.

CSV contract (one row per decision; extra columns are ignored)::

    section          taxa | persons | places | habitats
    name_form        the written name (matched case-insensitively)
    decision         same      the form denotes ``target`` (taxa: the GBIF taxon in ``authority``)
                     own       the form is an entity of its own: never merged into another,
                               taxa: the automatic GBIF link is dropped
                     none      not a taxon / person / place / habitat at all (misreading,
                               other organism, ...): its mentions are removed
                     mentions  decided per mention (value_corrections.csv), no form-level effect
                     unsure    no effect
                     link      the entity named ``target`` has the identifiers in ``authority``

                               habitats: eunis:<code> with ``eunis_match``)
